91,impact of prior exposure to information and priming for decisions
93,Belivability of true/false?  I'm not really sure.  I was curious at some of the answers.

116,Historical knowledge of the average American citizen.
117,See if people were primed into wrong answers if they saw a false statement on the initial list of statement pairs.

288,How gulliable a person is.  By testing their reasoning for thinking a question was true or false
290,To see how much we trust made up statements and see how others would feel about them.
292,"I think the study might have been testing our knowledge on US history. This could be a wild guess but I'm wondering if it's asking us questions that the United States asks immigrants who are trying to get citizenship into the United States. 

Otherwise, I think it was just asking us questions on basic geography and US history to see how much we know about our own country."
294,To study how likely we find a statement to be true or false after viewing it a second time?
295,to perceive how people react to stories that seem fake but not too far fetched and could be considered true as well.
296,I think what was being tested was general knowledge
299,"I honestly have no idea. The questions were the same at the beginning and the end, but one was for what I thought the average person would say and one was based on my knowledge."
300,I never think about what researchers' are testing because I think it would contaminate what their data.
310,"Perceptions of factual information. How I perceive other people to think about trivia, along with my own guesses."
315,I do not know what the main purpose was to accomplish
317,"Reasoning and ability to use logic maybe, I'm not really sure."

370,People's knowledge of notable American history in their confidence in the knowledge.
376,I'm not sure what was being tested in this study. So I can't really give an answer.
377,There was a large amount of general knowledge questions with respect to world history. Many I found to be untrue. Some questions were repeated. I assume the study revolved around memory recollection.
380,"Honestly, I have absolutely no clue what was being tested."
387,"How well ability to overcome instinctive responses to supposedly ""easy""/logical questions correlates with how sure you are about certain facts"
390,I have no idea. I thought it was what is was. Unless you were looking to see if people looked up the answers based on the time it took them.
391,Perceptions of factual statements and relativity.
393,The research question being tested in this study was general knowledge?
394,I think the research question being tested is if people will be more likely to say a statement is true if they have seen it before.
396,To see if statements we read earlier in the study influenced what we actually believe
397,"I would guess that, what was being studied here is the capacity of common knowledge"
399,To see if people can predict which historical fact is true or false.
402,would a participant likely judge a statement as being true if it was seen previously at beginning of study.

423,If we could recall what we answered at the beginning of the study.
434,how you judge things as true or false and reasoning.
435,To see how confident we were in our answers. To see how sure of ourselves we were.
436,I have no idea (this is me continuing to type because I am being forced to have at least 50 characters in the box.)
438,Maybe it was being tested if there's a link between how someone perceives what others would believe vs. what they personally believe
439,I have absolutely no idea what specific research question was was being tested in this study
441,correlation between questions being asked and a further question relating would change confidence in a given answer
442,I have no idea unless you were trying to tell whether people would think that the average american might think something was true which they themselves knew was false.
444,Maybe how we judge things related to our country's history vs other random facts
447,"Maybe how if one knows something as a fact, how many other people do they think know it? And if one doesn't know something, how many other people do they think also don't know it."
449,how seeing same thing more than once makes me think it is true
452,I don't have any clue on  what was actually being studied.
453,how the information presented a short time ago impacts our thoughts of false or true statements and our ability to recognise them
456,Recalled memories of facts we should know about our world
462,I can only think that the purpose was what the average persons general knowledge of history is.
464,Priming with false statements makes people more likely to believe them
475,Interpretation of true and false statements based on demographics
482,i have no idea. how the trivia questions relate somehow?
484,"to see how much you know about different things, topics"
485,Not really sure I guess I had to do with how plausible events are.
488,I think this was testing if we second guessed ourselves upon a second look at a factoid.
489,knowledge of facts and deciphering the truth in statements.
493,I am guessing that the purpose was to determine an individuals process of making a decision and how much they believed in that decision percentage wise.
494,It was to determine how the average person's perspective can influence your beliefs about facts and information.
495,Seeing if seeing statements we saw at the beginning of the study made us more likely to say they were true in the last part
496,Maybe testing the general knowledge Americans have of world events.
502,I have no idea what the more specific research questiong being tested in this study was.
505,"Whether people are more likely to agree with uncertain statements if they have been given more information beforehand, but I really don't have a good guess"
506,"I honestly have no idea, I guess they were testing my knowledge of general culture."
509,"I'm not sure, but usually there's more than one objective to a study. The purpose was/is probably to find out how much Americans know about the history of their own country in general."
515,Peoples biases in truth seeking and what they assume to be correct
518,i will say the research is try to test participants current Affairs knowledge
519,will say the research is trying  to test participants general knowledge
523,"I couldn't even begin to guess, honestly. I didn't really feel that I was being mislead so I don't know."
529,I honestly wouldn't be able to guess. I lost track of the overall flow of the study once I started trying to answer all the true/false questions.
533,"No idea. If you want me to actually guess, then pay your workers more. This is all you get for the money you paid."
539,To prove Americans are terrible at history knowledge?
541,"How we understand and reason with factual, historic information in a very politically divided age that seeks to erase or dismiss parts of history that are proven factual."
1,how does accuracy of responses measure over time as the participant gets exhausted doing the long survey?
7,I really have no idea but i enjoyed answering the trivia.
8,Whether people can draw context clues from other information that has already been given to tehm
11,I guess just a test of biases in relation to the earlier questions about what I think the average person thought
15,I really have no clue. I thought that it was what you said but now I'm not sure what you are researching
17,How people revise their decisions and beliefs after being shown many times.
22,I would assume that the researchers wanted to know if any if the questions appeared repeated and if they had obvious answers with them.
23,Thoughts on confidence in answers when presented with ambiguous questions.
25,"I really don't know to be honest I mean we were just rating statements whether we thought they would be true or false. There was like an aptitude test so I guess maybe to see how those correlate, but thats very general. I really don't know."
26,What you perceive to be true vs what others perceive to be true.
27,Im unsure of what else may have been being tested in this study
29,I really don't know. Something to do with confidence in decision making but I can't go any deeper into that.
31,"I honestly do not know but if i had to guess, it would be to test our memory of what we think is true."
32,To understand how people perceive historical events.
38,Ability to determine whether information online is true or false.
42,Getting known facts wrong or misinterpreted or confused
44,I do not have any ideas what they could be studying.
46,"Not sure, I thought it was just to measure responses to trivia questions"
54,I was being tested on my knowledge of world history and events.
57,felt like there was memory retention being tested.
63,I am not certain.  I took what I was told at face value.
65,How people perceive statements to be true or false?
66,How well people could tell if one part of the statement was false.
72,"I have no idea, maybe my knowledge of everyday facts and my confidence about them?"
75,I believe the main goal of this survey was to test the attention spans of the participants.
76,being able to detect truth or falsehood in a series of trivia facts
79,how believable the questions were and what questions most people would know the answers to
83,How much we know is true and believe appears to be.
84,Seeing what different demographics know about world and American history
89,To test how our accuracy in the first part related to our accuracy in the second part.
92,"Reasoning skills vs potentially political trivia, especially given this felt like AP US History all over again."
94,If people second guess their judgement for these questions after being asked which one is more likely to be assumed true?
98,To see if slight variations to the truth will make people lose confidence in their answers
102,can you recall information or just guess because it sounds close enough
103,I honestly couldn't say. I just couldn't second guess what the researchers are looking for.
104,Not sure what teh researchers were after with this study
106,I would say that this study investigated truth of statements and self perception of each statement partnered with perception of the average American's understanding or truth perception of each statement.
110,certainty of my beliefs/knowledge versus the general public
111,The reader's confidence on veracity of historical statements
121,To see if the questions I thought were true earlier is still true when answering them again.
123,"I honestly have no clue, it just felt like a generic knowledge test to see how much useless information I was aware of. Possibly to test my knowledge of some historical information versus people from other generations, to see how well I do in my thirties and how other people who are gen z, boomers, gen x were to do, etc."
124,I do not know what being tested in this study. Why does this answer have to be 50 characters?
129,"If people's preexposure to certain statements be they true or false made them more likely to think they were truthful? I'm not really sure what is exactly being tested, though!"
130,"Not sure, maybe something having to do with how we perceive facts."
133,"I'm not sure, maybe just guessing my own knowledge on the subjects/questions."
135,I am not exactly sure. Possible seeing how people remember information after asking more unrelated questions.
141,"If we used the process of elimination to determine what was true or not.. if an obviously untrue fact is presented, the other option is probably true."
145,To see how knowledgeable people are with quiz questions.
147,The general US history knowledge by the average participant?
151,"No idea, not especially interested in what it is either but I suspect you might tell me anyway."
158,general knowledge of current and historic events and some politics
160,"This is a tough call. The only thing I could think of is that either a. you were testing to see if repetition of information makes it seem more true or b. if our own person knowledge (or perceived knowledge) of a fact affects whether we feel others would find that fact more believable. Other than those possibilities, I have no clue."
168,I don't know. Maybe how we feel about false and true statements
169,How knowledgeable someone is. I am really unsure what else was being tested during this survey.
170,Does seeing information more than once reinforce thoughts of that statement being true/false.
171,To see how people think about how other people answer questions and their knowledge of trivia.
173,"Just a test of our general knowledge , but other than that I'm not sure"
174,To test how easily a person's ability to distinguish true and false facts and be altered.
175,Believability of different facts presented to different groups of people.
177,Whether people know more general knowledge about the US or other countries?
179,"I don't know and frankly, I don't really think it's my job to know. Wouldn't you want me to not have known while doing the study?"
180,How willing are people to guess false when they are uncertain?
183,"maybe as to whether the questions change our beliefs?  as in, they lead us to believe things by repetition that aren't true"
188,i'm not sure.  maybe seeing how well people could guess true or false on basic history questions
189,Perhaps just to see how knowledgeable people are in general?
190,Comprehension would be my guess. Although General educational knowledge would be the runner-up.
198,How confident you are in the knowledge you have? I am not sure of what exactly the specific question was being asked.
200,"At a guess, I would think the 'general knowledge' questions gave some insight into how a person sees the world, and the study was comparing that to their ability to think logically, with word-based math problems. Sorry - I don't have a clue!"
202,How knowledgeable people are about basic facts or basic information
207,How people could have their own version of the facts distorted by lies.
208,"I'm not sure, I'm just curious what the real purpose was."
211,Maybe see how confident answers would be between given two choices versus a scale to rate them on.
212,Perhaps something to do with intelligence and the ability to determine truth. I'm really not sure.
215,I don't know.  It may be about how prior judgments affect current judgments.
216,I don't know. It was probably about people's assumptions on trivia questions.
217,How accurate people guessed whether historical statements were true or false
219,"How does knowledge about American history and geography relate to age,gender, and income?"
223,I am not sure but it may have something to do with recall of information shown during the study.
224,How information given early on affected the true false question answers at the end.
225,To see how smart people are and how much they believe
231,"The more specific the claim, the greater chance a person would believe it"
232,"No idea.  Really?  You think it takes more than 50 characters to say ""no idea?""  Good grief..."
233,I couldn't say. Maybe whether people are more likely to believe a statement to be true than false. I noticed I was more likely to label a statement as maybe true than maybe false.
236,I think you were testing what I thought was the answer and what I thought other people would probably answer to see if I would change my thinking based on that idea.
237,"I have no idea. Maybe seeing something about confidence levels and how they change in certain conditions, like if there's the idea of being compared to others' performance/knowledge."
250,"I have no idea, maybe how confident people are about the original facts they read after the reasoning test?"
252,How people determine which answer is more believable based on their own general knowledge
255,Say same thing differently affect people conviction.
257,Whether or not you would believe someone else thinks something is true based on if you also think it is or is not
261,Whether popular opinion influences certain people's beliefs.
263,If ae believe more false facts if we are trying to predict that they are true
268,Whether an individual or average person knows true or false facts related to history and the united states.
276,"How knowledgeable the general public is vs how knowledgeable people think they are, ie, REAL knowledge vs believed knowledge.
"
281,If I think facts the far pre date me are automatically true just because I am not sure.
285,To be perfectly honest I really do not know what was being tested here.
297,To test the general knowledge of people and how the comprehend.
303,It  might be to test if participants believe they think they are smarter than the general population.
305,I guess to see if we would agree with what we think others would agree to be true
311,Perceptions of what other people believe about general knowledge topics.
313,"It is not my job here, to do yours! I suggest you quit asking or get reported for trying to get workers to do a job that is not theirs to do."
314,I think the repetition of trivia/false facts in different contexts altered what I thought was true
316,How certain people are the information they believe to be true.
321,If I perceive myself as being more knowledgeable about history than the average person?
322,Whether or not certain statements were could be determined as true or false.
326,"heck if I know, maybe our general knowledge or our confidence in our knowledge. Maybe our ability to reason"
331,"how confident we felt with the questions, and how believable the questions felt."
332,Specific memory about details of things and how confident we are
333,"To see what answer we picked in the first part of the study, if we thought they were true when you asked true or false matched the answers we picked on the multiple choice?"
336,Maybe how smart I thought others in this country are and if by own knowledge would bias that?
337,I'm really unsure! Perhaps it was my answers and how different they were from what I think the average American would answer the question.
341,"Maybe seeing how people's general knowledge relates to what they think other people will believe, like if they think it is true, do they also think others think the same."
343,no idea at all really don't know don't appreciate being made to guess
344,Maybe if repetition would change how we think about things.
345,I think basic knowledge is what was being tested in this study.
347,"I have absolutely no idea. Seriously. You give the study, I take the study. The less I know the better."
348,My willingness to buy into whether given statements were true or not.
349,"I'm not really sure, maybe seeing if certain factors influenced later answers."
356,I guess to see what we think the general public would believe compared to what we believe.
364,I know I answered some of the questions incorrectly. I am not so sure what the study is about.
366,"The first part was predicting how I thought the average person would answer, the second was how I would answer.  Perhaps the study compares how I would judge based on what I think I know?"
367,"I have no idea, and it won't let me submit unless I type 50 characters, so I have to find a longer way of saying I don't know what was being tested."
368,General knowledge versus memory recall in a series of true and false statements
372,I'm not sure. Maybe trying to understand people's knowledge versus what they think other people know.
374,"just a general knowledge of American population on Aerican history, popular questions, etc"
375,To see the difference between what people say they believe and what they actually believe.
378,How people with specific demographics/backgrounds perceive historical facts of varying import.
379,I think the purpose may have been to see how much our personal knowledge about true/false statements agrees with what the average person believes.
381,After coming across logic problems I was struck with the thought that possibly the project could be about if we would respond differently to the same statements made before the logic problems then after the logic problems.
386,Test my general knowledge about history subjects and see if I can do it under pressure
401,I am not certain as to what this question might be.
407,To see whether people were willing to cheat and lie in order to look up correct facts of information given.
411,I'm really not sure but a lot of studies are deceiving
417,I have no idea.  The PhDs and PhD candidates are masters at obscuring what they are studying.
419,"Testing memory, or believability of certain facts."
421,Maybe it was about how more correct or intelligent people think they are versus the average person
426,I'm not sure.  There were times when similar questions were asked with slightly different info.  I would think it would be something to do with that.
427,How people form beliefs or change them based on different circumstances
430,General historical and geographical knowledge and basic intelligence and reasoning skills
432,How using your brain to solve math problems affects other things?
437,"Perhaps, whether people's beliefs change even in a brief amount of time, especially if given related context clues."
443,Im guessing it was to be able to tell how much a person perceives a statement t be true or false.
445,How people doubt their general knowledge when under pressure.
448,I think this was to see if how a question is phrased changes peoples answers.
455,How well you can point out factual statements and your ability to recognize misinformation
458,"How accurately does one remember well known facts that ""everyone"" has heard about at some point. in their lives."
461,i cannot say for certain it was not clear to me that there was
465,I think maybe the study was looking at the difference between what facts I perceive to be true or false and comparing them to what I think the average person will find more believable I don't know what the specific hypothesis would be though.
472,How people are influenced by the opinions of others.
473,idk how to put it into words so ill use this as an example: i realized my mistake with Michelangelo and Da Vinci..Michelangelo didn't paint the last supper.. It was Leonardo da Vinci... And I realize that slight mistake but then it kind of changed up a little bit only changed a little bit of the wording the next time I answered it I don't know what that's called it's kind of like the example I'm trying to explain that's the best way I know how.
478,I am not really sure what is being tested in this study
480,unsure - maybe seeing if I think my own knowledge matched up to the general perceptions of the population
481,I don't know but I figure there's another reason since you're researchers.
483,no idea what else it could be apart from what was earlier stated in the survey
487,How confident I was in my original responses and if I did any additional research when given the questions the second time.
490,"How much history we know. I felt like I was being quizzed on many historical facts,"
503,overall perceptions of trivia based on reasoning ability
508,It's hard to say what this study is about but maybe it's to understand how we judge true based on how the sentence is put.
522,I've no idea.  But that isn't fifty characters so I have to write some more.
527,"It was confusing because some questions came in different forms which made me wonder if what i have said before was true or if it was correct but then I still don't know what the study is for, it's really hard to guess."
535,I think it was interested in how people believe other people will respond to trivia questions in aggregate.
538,I don't know. It might have something to do with whether certain facts that are presented to us have any bearing on how we feel about whether those facts are true or not later.
540,Whether or not I would contradict myself in my answers.  Because I know I did at least once. LOL
6,something about giving us fake factoids at the start to see if we'd believe them when brought up again later
9,If I had to guess I would think that it is judging other people about what they think is correct.

39,I'm not really sure. I can't even come up with a guess.
43,I have no idea what it would be so I have no guess.
47,It is testing my general knowledge with trivia about different subjects.
48,How learning or recalling a fact makes us likely to rate another fact as true or false
50,I am guessing you want to assess people's general knowledge skills
56,I truly couldn't guess and really haven't the faintest idea.
59,I would guess just looking at how well people know history.
64,How much people's confidence in true/false statements changed based on reading differing statements.

109,The ability to take a true staement and infer the false assertion when stated.
112,If people with logical reasoning skills were more likely to have a good grasp on general knowledge

163,How people remembered and reflected on issues current and ancient
164,Whether certainty would be the same when advising others rather than making own judgement

186,To see if one's knowledge of any event effects the way it's rated as believable by others.
197,People's memories for statements or historical facts.
205,How you think others think of different trivia questions vs you.
210,"How asking other questions changes answers. For example, information about Disney parks can be gleaned from asking about World vs Land."
218,I'm not really sure what you were testing for during this study.
226,I would guess it was to determine people's general knowledge on popular subjects?
229,I am not really sure. Maybe trying to see what characteristics make a statement seem more believable.
230,How confident people are with memory given choices.
234,People's ability to stay focused through multiple questions
239,Maybe it has something to do with confidence? I don't know
240,To see if how I believe other people will answer questions influences how I answer the same questions after a brief delay.
241,Maybe just to see how some people believe outlandish things. I'm not sure I could detect what its true purpose was.
242,I thought the true purpose of this study was to interpret if people have false memories about events in history.

279,"To maybe see if seeing the ""facts"" already biased us to think they were true later"
282,A person's confidence in answers vs actual answers?
283,Maybe whether or not previously judging information as possibly being correct would influence a person's decisions later in determining whether or not the same information was true.
284,I don't know. I have no idea and no guess. I didn't think I there was some hidden test.
298,Not really sure at all here. Possibly how people separate facts when given small amounts of misinformation mixed in
302,I really have no idea what might have been being tested.
304,"honestly, to see if people would look answers up rather than use thier own minds"
306,test general knowledge and to see if you changed your mind when asked the same question twice.
307,Seems like a civics test. It could possibly be a test on fake headlines.
318,Part of it involves pattern recognition and the ability to see the same thought rephrased to ask the same question.
320,I don't have any idea what the specific research question would be.
324,"Does the fact that a statement has been seen before by a survey respondent influence how ""true"" or ""believable"" that statement seems to be, upon the second time it is viewed by the survey taker?"

369,Our general knowledge of events but I am not really sure what the purpose of the study was.
371,Whether having seen a statement once we are prone to believe it when seeing it a second time.
373,"To see if human reasoning/thinking/memory could be swayed by "" true or false"" statements that confused the user"
384,"I really don't think I could guess, it could be a lot of different things and I don't feel informed enough to chose between them."
385,I am not certain. I was only focusing on the questions and how to best answer them.
389,I do not know what research question was being tested.

474,I have no idea. I could hazard a guess and say it might have something to do with Government or civics. Sad to say other then that I'm clueless.
476,Perhaps it was related to testing the tendency of people to believe incorrect statements.
477,I would guess it has to do with how most people remember information they have learned or have been told about. Some of the statements were correct but the person that was involved was different than the one that was reffered to.
491,Retention of information either taught in schools or general level of education of a populace
497,Maybe quiz on our knowledge in general. Otherwise maybe some type personality test?

511,It seemed like an IQ test at some points but I'm very unsure.
512,something about what people are willing to believe
